# netsuspend - system usage-aware suspension and hibernation utility

Suspends or hibernates its host system based on the amount its components are being used, rather than the amount of user interaction.  Useful for headless servers that are barely used.

Monitors CPU, disk, network, and user account interaction.  The system is suspended or hibernated after some or all of these components are "not busy" for a configurable length of time.
